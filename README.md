Repository for files for Scratch 4 Arduino (s4a.cat) workshop. These items were orginially created by the author while at Virginia Tech.

To begin working with S4A you must: (1) install the S4A firmware on an Arduino and (2) install the S4A installer on your own machine. The firmware can be found in the [S4AFirmware16] folder and the installers for Win/OSX/Linux in [Installers]. FTDI serial drivers are also provided for each particular OS. Although these may no longer be needed.

Additionally, "user-friendly" data sheets for various sensors are included in [Sensor Datasheets] and sample projects for each sensor are provided in the [Scratch Projects] folder.

A sample presentation is provided that can be used as a walkthrough and introduction to the language basics.

Have fun!
